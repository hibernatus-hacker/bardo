# Distributed Architecture for Algorithmic Trading

This document outlines the distributed architecture for training and running algorithmic trading agents across multiple machines.

## Overview

The distributed architecture consists of three main components:

1. **Coordinator**: Central node that manages the distributed system
2. **Training Nodes**: Nodes responsible for evolving and training trading agents
3. **Execution Nodes**: Nodes responsible for running agents in production

## Components

### Coordinator Node

The coordinator is the central management component that:

- Manages the cluster of nodes
- Distributes work to training nodes
- Collects and aggregates results
- Maintains the repository of best agents
- Provides monitoring and administration interface

#### Key Services:
- **Node Registry**: Tracks available nodes and their status
- **Task Scheduler**: Assigns training tasks to nodes
- **Agent Repository**: Stores trained agents
- **Data Synchronization**: Ensures data consistency across nodes
- **Performance Monitor**: Tracks system performance metrics

### Training Nodes

Training nodes are responsible for:

- Running evolutionary algorithms to develop trading strategies
- Processing historical market data
- Evaluating trading agents on simulated environments
- Reporting results back to the coordinator

#### Key Services:
- **Data Processor**: Prepares market data for training
- **Evolution Engine**: Runs the evolutionary algorithm
- **Simulation Environment**: Tests agents on historical data
- **Result Reporter**: Sends training results to coordinator

### Execution Nodes

Execution nodes are responsible for:

- Running trained agents in live production environments
- Connecting to brokers for real-time trading
- Collecting performance metrics of deployed agents
- Enabling continuous learning of deployed agents

#### Key Services:
- **Broker Interface**: Connects to trading APIs
- **Agent Runner**: Executes trading logic
- **Performance Tracker**: Monitors trading performance
- **Continuous Learning**: Updates agents based on live performance

## Data Flow

1. **Training Process**:
   - Coordinator assigns training tasks with specific parameters
   - Training nodes fetch required historical data
   - Nodes evolve populations of trading agents
   - Best agents are reported back to coordinator
   - Coordinator aggregates results and updates the agent repository

2. **Deployment Process**:
   - Coordinator selects agents for production deployment
   - Execution nodes download agent configurations
   - Nodes connect to brokers and begin trading
   - Performance metrics are reported back to coordinator
   - Coordinator may reassign or update agents based on performance

3. **Continuous Learning**:
   - Execution nodes collect trading performance data
   - Agents are updated using reinforcement learning
   - Updated agents are synchronized with the repository
   - Improved agents may be redistributed to other nodes

## Communication Protocol

All communication between nodes uses Erlang's native distribution mechanisms with additional security layers:

- **Node Authentication**: Certificate-based node authentication
- **Message Encryption**: TLS encryption for all inter-node communication
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Regular status checks to ensure node health
- **Message Queueing**: Asynchronous message handling with retry mechanisms

## Scalability

The architecture supports dynamic scaling:

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more training or execution nodes as needed
- **Task Partitioning**: Break large training tasks into smaller units
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute workload based on node capacity
- **Resource Pooling**: Share computational resources efficiently

## Fault Tolerance

The system is designed to be resilient to failures:

- **Node Failure Detection**: Quick identification of failed nodes
- **Task Reassignment**: Redistribution of work from failed nodes
- **State Persistence**: Regular checkpointing of training progress
- **Redundancy**: Critical components have backup instances
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues with reduced capacity when nodes fail

## Security Considerations

- **Network Isolation**: Separate networks for training and execution
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for system operations
- **Data Protection**: Encryption of sensitive data (API keys, trade history)
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all system activities
- **Secure Configuration**: Protection of system configuration

## Implementation

The distributed architecture leverages Elixir/Erlang's OTP framework:

- **GenServers**: For stateful service components
- **Supervisors**: For fault tolerance and process management
- **Registry**: For service discovery
- **PubSub**: For event distribution
- **Distributed Erlang**: For inter-node communication
- **EPMD**: For node name resolution

### Node Discovery and Management

Nodes discover and join the cluster through:

1. **Static Configuration**: Pre-configured node addresses
2. **DNS Discovery**: Finding nodes through DNS service records
3. **Gossip Protocol**: Nodes sharing information about other nodes
4. **Leader Election**: Selecting coordinator nodes dynamically

## Monitoring and Administration

The architecture includes comprehensive monitoring:

- **Dashboard**: Web interface for system status and management
- **Metrics Collection**: Gathering performance data across nodes
- **Alerting**: Notification system for critical events
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging for troubleshooting
- **Command Interface**: Administrative CLI for system management

## Performance Considerations

To ensure high performance:

- **Resource Isolation**: Dedicated resources for critical operations
- **Data Locality**: Processing data close to where it's stored
- **Batched Communication**: Reducing network overhead
- **Caching**: Storing frequently accessed data in memory
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations where possible

## Extensions and Future Work

- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically adjust cluster size based on workload
- **Multi-region Support**: Distribute nodes across geographical regions
- **Hardware Acceleration**: GPU support for neural network training
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Support for mixed on-premise and cloud deployments
- **Custom Hardware Integration**: Support for FPGA or ASIC acceleration
