  # setup do

  #   mock_pid = spawn(fn -> Process.sleep(100) end)
  #   expect(PopulationManager, :start, fn node ->

  #   {:ok, worker_pid} = PopulationManagerWorker.start_link()
  #   
  #   # Return the test context
  #   %{worker_pid: worker_pid, mock_pid: mock_pid}
  # end
  # 
  # test "initializes with a population manager process", %{worker_pid: worker_pid} do
  #   state = :sys.get_state(worker_pid)
  #   assert is_pid(state.population_manager_pid)
  # end
  # 
  # test "terminates the population manager process when terminating", %{worker_pid: worker_pid, mock_pid: mock_pid} do
  #   # Create a monitor for the mock process to detect when it receives the stop message
  #   Process.monitor(mock_pid)
  #   
  #   # Terminate the worker
  #   GenServer.stop(worker_pid)
  #   
  #   # We should receive a :DOWN message when the mock process terminates
  #   assert_receive {:DOWN, _, :process, ^mock_pid, _}, 500
  # end
  
  # Placeholder test
